# EPSErrorHandling

EPSErrorHandling provides a category on `UIViewController` (`ErrorHandling`) which adds a method for presenting errors:

```objective-c
- (void)eps_presentError:(NSError *)error;
```

By default, `eps_presentError:` will show an alert using the `localizedDescription` of `error` as its title, and `localizedFailureReason` as the message. This method should be overridden in subclasses of `UIViewController` to customize error handling for specific situations.

## Using with ReactiveCocoa

EPSErrorHandling can be used as a standard way to handles errors generated by `RACCommand` objects. For example:

```objective-c
[self rac_liftSelector:@selector(eps_presentError:) withSignals:self.viewModel.loginCommand.errors, nil];
```

## Installation

EPSErrorHandling is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "EPSErrorHandling"
```

Alternatively, include `UIViewController+ErrorHandling.h` and `UIViewController+ErrorHandling.m` in your project.
